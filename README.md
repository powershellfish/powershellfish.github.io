# 💻 powershellfish's GitHub Page

>This is the main page for my GitHub projects and where I will show you what I'm working on. I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to render my default README markdown file into this webpage. 
>
>This process was kind of confusing to me when I was new to Git/coding/markdown, so I wrote a short walkthrough [here](https://github.com/powershellfish/powershellfish.github.io/wiki/How-I-Set-Up-My-GitHub-User-Page). The walkthrough assumes no prior knowledge for any part of the process or the tools used to complete it.

>>(*You can also get to the walkthrough by going to the Wiki and clicking the **How I Set Up My GitHub User Page** section.*)

# 💾 Git Stuff

## Repos 
I have a handful of repos. You can read more about what each of them does below.

> 💬 This is mainly for my benefit so I can see everything at-a-glance on the main page.

* [Actual Projects](https://powershellfish.github.io/Actual-Projects/): Mostly-finished projects I've built from scratch, or using requirements that did not come from an exercise. You can download and run them. 
* [Main Git Page](https://powershellfish.github.io): You're on this page right now. 
* [Codecademy Projects](https://powershellfish.github.io/Codecademy-Projects/): Projects I developed on Codecademy (shocking).
* [Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner: 3rd Edition](https://powershellfish.github.io/python_programming_3e/): Exercises from the Python book I'm using.
* [Powershell](https://powershellfish.github.io/powershell/): Where I keep my powershell scripts. I am most fond of this one.✨

# 🎀About Me/Philosophy

>My name is Powershellfish and I am a technical communicator and general tech nerd. I take highly technical information from different sources and turn it into something that makes sense for different audiences. I do stuff like talk to developers (subject matter experts or **SMEs** for short) to understand what they're working on, how to set it up, how to use what they've built, and how to troubleshoot any potential issues users could run into when using the product. 
>
>I'm really passionate about taking information and making it accessible to others - whether that means translating textual information and concepts into a format novices will understand, or taking data and numbers and producing a visualization that more clearly communicates what's going on. At the end of the day, I love taking information, whether it's text or data - and turning it into something that anyone can pick up and interpret with minimal, if any, barriers to access.


## What I Do

>### Professional
>>* Interview SMEs and take *lots* of notes
