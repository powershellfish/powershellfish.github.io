# powershellfish's GitHub Page

Here's the default **README**. This is designed to be a test project and where I will show you what I'm working on.

# A Little Bit About Me and What I Do

My name is powershellfish and I am a Technical Writer. I take highly technical information from different sources and turn it into something that makes sense for different audiences. I do stuff like talk to developers (subject matter experts or **SMEs** for short) to understand what they're working on, how to set it up, how to use what they've built, and how to troubleshoot any potential issues users could run into when using the product. 

## What I Do

### Professional
* Interview SMEs and take lots of notes 
* Translate technical information and put it into the correct format according to the audience
* Work directly with the product so that I can write about it
* Develop tutorials
* Learn and adapt to dynamic and rapidly changing projects
* Support my colleagues and foster an environment where can all work together towards a common goal

### Personal
* Hike and hang out with my dog, Gizmo
* Build miniatures and create video tutorials on how others can construct them
* Obsessively keep learning new things about GitHub, SQL and data analysis

## What I Do *Not* Do

* Psychically or automatically know what information needs to be included or excluded in documentation
* Write information that people won't want to use
* Get bored

# What you can expect to see here in the future

I plan to experiment with some stuff here, like:
- [ ] Python
- [ ] PowerShell scripts
- [ ] HTML and CSS
- [ ] A maybe a little JavaScript!
