I have a handful of repos. You can read more about what each of them does below.

* [Actual Projects](https://powershellfish.github.io/Actual-Projects/): Mostly-finished projects I've built from scratch, or using requirements that did not come from an exercise. You can download and run them.

* [Codecademy Projects](https://powershellfish.github.io/Codecademy-Projects/): Projects I developed on Codecademy (shocking).
* [Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner: 3rd Edition](https://powershellfish.github.io/python_programming_3e/): Exercises from the Python book I'm using.
* [Powershell](https://powershellfish.github.io/powershell/): Where I keep my powershell scripts. I am most fond of this one.✨

## Projects

### OpenSearch Project and Data Prepper

My most recent project that I have been working on is documentation for the [OpenSearch project](https://opensearch.org/), specifically for [Data Prepper](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/data-prepper/index/) and the plugins you can use with it. I have had so much fun using this distributed search and analytics engine and working with the community to learn more about its many use cases. Data Prepper has been a particularly fascinating tool to play with while I work on completing my data analyst certificate program. 
>You can view the work I've done on OpenSearch [here](https://github.com/carolxob). Please note that I'm working on creating a summary page to make it easier to view that work.

# 🎀About Me/Philosophy

>My name is Caroline and I am a technical communicator and general tech enthusiast. I take highly technical information from different sources and turn it into something that makes sense for different audiences. I do stuff like talk to developers (subject matter experts or **SMEs** for short) to understand what they're working on, how to set it up, how to use what they've built, and how to troubleshoot any potential issues users could run into when using the product. I also configure my own environment and run the software myself so best understand the needs of the users I support. 
>
>I'm really passionate about taking information and making it accessible to others - whether that means translating textual information and concepts into a format novices will understand, or taking data and numbers and producing a visualization that more clearly communicates what's going on. I smash barriers to access information. I'm also a big fan of constant improvement, so if you have any suggestions on how to make what I've built better, please submit an issue!
