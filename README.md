# powershellfish's GitHub Page

Here's the default **README** for my user page. This is designed to be a test project and where I will show you what I'm working on. I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to render my default README markdown file into this webpage. 

Want to know how I set this up? Check out my short walkthrough [here](https://github.com/powershellfish/powershellfish.github.io/wiki/How-I-Set-Up-My-GitHub-User-Page). 

(FYI, you can also get to the walkthrough by going to the Wiki and clicking the **How I Set Up My GitHub User Page** section.)

# A Little Bit About Me and What I Do

My name is Caroline and I am a technical communicator. I take highly technical information from different sources and turn it into something that makes sense for different audiences. I do stuff like talk to developers (subject matter experts or **SMEs** for short) to understand what they're working on, how to set it up, how to use what they've built, and how to troubleshoot any potential issues users could run into when using the product. 

## What I Do

### Professional
* Interview SMEs and take *lots* of notes 
* Work directly with the product so that I can write about it
* Translate technical information and put it into the correct format according to the audience
* Develop training materials
* Learn and adapt to dynamic and rapidly changing projects
* Support my colleagues and foster an environment where we can work as a team towards a common goal

### Personal
* Hike and hang out with my dog, Gizmo
* Build miniatures and create video tutorials on how others can construct them
* Spend time learning new things about GitHub, professional/technical communications, SQL and Python

## What I Do *Not* Do

* Leave things as "good enough"
* Write information or make learning materials that people won't want to use or that are not accessible
* Get bored

# What you can expect to see here in the future

I plan to experiment with some stuff here, like:
- [ ] Python
- [ ] PowerShell scripts
- [ ] HTML and CSS
- [ ] A maybe a little JavaScript!
