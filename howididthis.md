# How I Did This - An Overview

If you're not familiar with GitHub or GitHub pages, it can be overwhelming to figure out how version control works and what order to perform the steps in correctly to get your page to display. A *great* place to start is the [GitHub Pages Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). The GitHub guide will walk you through the process of creating the website for your username or project page. 

You can even select from a few nifty themes:

Cool Themes | OK Themes
------------ | -------------
Cayman | Slate
Merlot | Minimal
Time Machine | Leap Day

# Stuff You Should Probably Learn Before Doing This

Creating a page in GitHub isn't difficult, but you will want to get familiar with the following items before continuing:
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) - this is the format README files are stored in on GitHub. You can edit the text using some basic symbols and Jekyll will render it into the webpage format you'll see later. Here's what it looks like when I'm editing my page in SublimeText: ![SublimeTextScreenshot](https://github.com/powershellfish/powershellfish.github.io/blob/master/sublimetextscreenshot.jpg) 
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - This application allows you to make commits, checkout branches and edit your GitHub page using Mardown in your preferred editor. In this case, I have chosen to use [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as my editor, but you can also use a tool like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Here's what it looks like when I'm commiting my edits to the master respository for **powershellfish** : ![GitHubDesktopScreenshot](https://github.com/powershellfish/powershellfish.github.io/blob/master/githubdesktop%20screenshot.jpg)
 
# What You Need To Do

Without further delay, here's how I got everything that you see here to display the way it is displaying:

1. Download GitHub Dektop and login using your GitHub credentials.
2. Download SublimeText (or equivalent).
3. Use the [GitHub Pages Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to create a GitHub page and select a theme.
4. Open GitHub Desktop and click the **Open in Sublime Text** button. You should see something like the screenshot for GitHub Desktop above.
5. Edit the README.md file using markown. Feel free to play with GitHub flavored markown. It doesn't bite! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
6. Save your file in SublimeText (press **Ctrl + S** if you are using a Windows machine). 
7. Select the GitHub Desktop window. You should see your changes reflected for your markdown file on the screen. Add any notes in the **Description** field and click **Commit to master**. You should see something that looks like this: 
![Commit](https://github.com/powershellfish/powershellfish.github.io/blob/master/githubdesktopcommit.jpg)
8. Click **Push origin**.
9. Return to your web browser and refresh the markdown page you edited. You should see your changes.
