# How I Did This

If you're not familiar with GitHub or GitHub pages, it can be overwhelming to figure out how version control works and what order to perform the steps in correctly to get your page to display. A *great* place to start is the [GitHub Pages Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). The GitHub guide will walk you through the process of creating the website for your username or project page. 

You can even select from a few nifty themes:

Cool Themes | OK Themes
------------ | -------------
Cayman | Slate
Merlot | Minimal
Time Machine | Leap Day
