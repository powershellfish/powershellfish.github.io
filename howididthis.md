# How I Did This - An Overview

If you're not familiar with GitHub or GitHub pages, it can be overwhelming to figure out how version control works and what order to perform the steps in correctly to get your page to display. A *great* place to start is the [GitHub Pages Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). The GitHub guide will walk you through the process of creating the website for your username or project page. 

You can even select from a few nifty themes:

Cool Themes | OK Themes
------------ | -------------
Cayman | Slate
Merlot | Minimal
Time Machine | Leap Day

# Stuff You Should Probably Learn Before Doing This

Creating a page in GitHub isn't difficult, but you will want to get familiar with the following items before continuing:
- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) - this is the format README files are stored in on GitHub. You can edit the text using some basic symbols and Jekyll will render it into the webpage format you'll see later.
- 

Without further delay, here's how I got everything that you see here to display the way it is displaying:

1. Use the [GitHub Pages Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to create a GitHub page and select a theme.
2. Modify the README.md file.
